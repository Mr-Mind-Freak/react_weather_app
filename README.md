# React-Weather-App

 **Author**: _K.R.Navaneethan_

This is a simple responsive weather app and my first react project after learning react. Even though it is a simple app, I've given my best as a beginner on react.

Keep going.....Happy coding ‚ù§

## Things I Used:
* In this project, I've used react router version 6
* A free API for weather forecasting [Oper Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)
* Some websites for free images:
